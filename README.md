# Password-Complexity-Checker
A tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength. Its a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that evaluates the strength of a password. It provides insights into password entropy, estimated time to crack, and offers suggestions to improve password security.

# Features

Calculates password entropy based on character sets used.
Estimates the time required to crack the password assuming 1 billion guesses per second.
Integrates with the zxcvbn library for comprehensive strength assessment (if installed).
Checks against a list of common passwords to warn users.
Provides actionable suggestions to enhance password complexity.
User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Optional: zxcvbn library for enhanced analysis

Install dependencies (if zxcvbn is to be used):
pip install zxcvbn


Note: The application uses Tkinter, which is included with most Python installations. If not available, install it via your system's package manager.
Usage

# Run the application:

python password_checker.py

Enter your password in the input field and click Analyze Password to see the analysis results.

# Customization
The list of common passwords is loaded from common-password.txt. 
Ensure this file exists in the same directory or update the path in the code.
You can modify the password analysis parameters or suggestions by editing the respective functions in the script.

# Acknowledgments
Uses Tkinter for GUI components.
Optional integration with zxcvbn for improved password strength estimation.
